For a detailed description please refer to the publication. You can set up a Python environment using the requirements file. We are not allowed to provide the necessary data to make the models running. However, the meteorological input data are available via [DWD-Opendata](https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/CDC/grids_germany/daily/hyras_de/), the groundwater data are partly published here [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.4683879.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4683879). The rest of the groundwater data is publicly available via the sources indicated in the locations.csv file.

Our models are implemented in Tensorflow 2.7.0, so please use a compatible Python Version for the environment (e.g., Python 3.8.10).
